                Civilization 6 is a turn based strategy game with historical elements. There are multiple ways to finish a game. You can become peaceful with all the other civilizations and let tourists into your country or if you want to you can conquer all the other civilizations and dominate the world. If you don't like any of these then you can spread your own custom made religion across the world. You can also be the first one to land on the mars and colonize it. A game takes about 5 hours (on standard difficulty) to finish. After you finished a game you can always choose another leader or another playstyle to play the game.
